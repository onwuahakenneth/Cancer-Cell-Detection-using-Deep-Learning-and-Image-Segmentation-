Unfortunately, with very sparse class representations the pixel accuracy will be biased towards negative cases. We have addressed thsi issue by assigning a class to the background as well as opting for mean intersection over union (IOU). For our ground truth and predicted segmenation masks, we count the number of pixels that overlap and divide by the total area of both masks; value will be 0-1, the higher the value, the better.\n","</p>\n","<p>&emsp;IOU = <u>number of overlapping pixels (intersection)</u></br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;True area + Predicted area − intersection</p>\n","\n","Dice coefficient will the same answer but maybe not the same value; we will use IOU."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14619,"status":"ok","timestamp":1725917770998,"user":{"displayName":"Doug C","userId":"03753993097516619119"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"MdeitbFnKTCc","outputId":"1bf1e014-d461-477b-a27c-38d5d6203c06"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","def evaluate_model(model, data: NDArray, r_file: str, r_desc: str, vanilla: bool=False):\n","    ''' A custom function to handle the model's evaluation\n","    '''\n","\n","    if RETRAIN_IMG_MODEL or not os.path.exists(r_file):\n","        metrics = model.evaluate(x=data['x_test'], y=data['y_test'])\n","        save_results(metrics, r_file, r_desc)\n","    else:\n","        metrics = load_results(r_file, r_desc)\n","\n","    return metrics\n","\n","# plot loss and IOU metrics\n","def display_metrics(train_m, test_m, title):\n","    ''' Shows the metrics of the trained/loaded model\n","    '''\n","\n","    print(f'{title}...')\n","    print(f\"Best Train loss: {min(train_m['loss']):.3f}\")\n","    print(f\"Best Train seg iou: {max(train_m['iou']):.3f}\")\n","    print(f\"Best validation loss: {min(train_m['val_loss']):.3f}\")\n","    print(f\"Best validation seg iou: {max(train_m['val_iou']):.3f}\")\n","    print(f\"Test loss: {test_m[0]:.3f}\")\n","    print(f\"Test seg iou: {test_m[1]:.3f}\")\n","\n","    _, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(8, 6), sharex=True, sharey=False)\n","    # fig.suptitle(title)\n","\n","    ax[0].plot(train_m['loss'], label='Train Loss')\n","    ax[0].plot(train_m['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')\n","    ax[0].scatter(len(train_m['loss']), test_m[0], label='Test Loss', color='green')\n","    ax[0].set(xlabel='Epoch', ylabel='Loss')\n","\n","    ax[1].plot(train_m['iou'], label='Train IOU')\n","    ax[1].plot(train_m['val_iou'], label='Validation IOU')\n","    ax[1].scatter(len(train_m['iou']), test_m[1], label='Test IoU', color='green')\n","    ax[1].set(xlabel='Epoch', ylabel='Seg IOU')\n","\n","    plt.legend(['Train', 'Validation'])\n","    plt.tight_layout()\n","    plt.show()\n","\n","# perform evaluation and display results for tuned/untuned transfer models\n","desc = 'Segmenation Metrics (non-tuned transfer model)'\n","test_m1 = evaluate_model(img_model1, img_data, model_info['img_test_nontuned_results'], desc, vanilla=True)\n","display_metrics(train_m1, test_m1, desc)\n","\n","# perform evaluation and display results for tuned/untuned\n","desc = 'Segmenation Metrics (tuned transfer model)'\n","test_m2 = evaluate_model(img_model2, img_data, model_info['img_test_tuned_results'], desc)\n","display_metrics(train_m2, test_m2, desc)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["##### Testing the Segmentation Models"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["y_img_pred1 = img_model1.predict(x_img_test)\n","y_img_pred2 = img_model2.predict(x_img_test)\n","\n","y_img_pred_classes1 = [np.argmax(pred, -1) for pred in y_img_pred1]\n","y_img_pred_classes2 = [np.argmax(pred, -1) for pred in y_img_pred2]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["_, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 15));\n","ax = ax.ravel()\n","\n","ax[0].imshow(y_img_test[0]);\n","ax[0].set_title('True Mask');\n","ax[0].axis('off');\n","ax[1].imshow(y_img_pred_classes1[0]);\n","ax[1].set_title('Non-tuned Weights');\n","ax[1].axis('off');\n","ax[2].imshow(y_img_pred_classes2[0]);\n","ax[2].set_title('Tuned Weights');\n","ax[2].axis('off');"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.18"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
